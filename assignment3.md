# ASSIGNMENT 3: CLEANING DATA 

* The link to the original dataset can be found [here](https://github.com/meaghandowney/datajournalism-fall23/blob/main/hst_vote01%20-%20ORIGINAL.xlsx).

* This  dataset included voter turnout data across multiple demographics so the "cleaning" I did was to narrowing the data down to the demographic information I needed: voter turnout for the 18-24 age group in presidential elections since 2004.

* The interesting question I am answering is: Was youth voter turnout the largest in 2008 and 2020? I am asking this question because in both the 2008 and 2020 presidential elections, the youth vote was heavily discussed in by the media and identified as *the* determining factor in both elections' ultimate outcomes.

* The pivot table I created revealed that the 2012 and 2016 presidential elections saw the largest number of 18-24 year old voters with 29,878 18-24 year olds voting in 2012 and 29,320 18-24 year olds voting in 2016. I was surprised to find that the 18-24 year old voter turnout in 2008 and 2020 was even less than the age group's turnout in the 2010, 2018 and 2022 midterm elections.
