# ASSIGNMENT 1 – DATA-DRIVEN INVESTIGATION CRITIQUE

The Story I Read: [Lawless: One in three Alaska villages have no local police](https://www.adn.com/alaska-news/lawless/2019/05/16/lawless-one-in-three-alaska-villages-have-no-local-police/)

## Clarity and Accuracy 

* **Were you able to immediately identify the central insight the reporter was trying to communicate?**
  * 4 - The central insight was that Alaskan villages have limited police protection and some even have no local police force.
  * Yes, the central insight was in the headline. 
* **If there was a data visualization, were you able to understand how to read it?** 
  * 4 – The only data visualization in this story was a map of Alaska with red dots representing the Alaskan villages with no local law enforcement in 2019. It was easy to understand and required no navigation.		
  * This piece missed out on opportunities for data visualization. I think a line graph could have been used to visualize the declines in Alaskan village police force numbers overtime. The piece also cites that having a police presence is “key to reducing suicide, alcohol abuse and other problems …” – this data could have been supported with a graph or chart showing the relationship between police force numbers and suicide, alcohol abuse, etc.
* **Using your own knowledge and critical thinking abilities, do you think the data was accurate?**
  * 3 – Most of the data in this story read as accurate. The only areas that were arguably “grey” were the human components of the story, especially once it was revealed that VPSO Annie Reed  - who at that point had been the central figure of the story – had her own history with domestic struggles (both herself and her family). 
  The article did state “oil taxes and savings accounts that were built upon oil taxes, pay the bills in Alaska,” and I felt that this data would need to be further investigated to verify its accuracy.
  * To verify the legitimacy of the incidents Annie Reed and other officers spoke about, I would suggest the reporter check Alaskan crime data. One resource would be the Alaska Department of Public Safety’s website where each year a Uniform Crime Reporting Program Annual Report is published providing data on the numbers of crimes and types of crimes reported that year statewide and for each police department (even VPSO regions).
  * To verify how much of “oil taxes and savings accounts that were built upon oil taxes” do in fact “pay the bills in Alaska,” the reporter can look at the Alaska Oil and Gas Association (AOGA’s) website where data is listed showing how much of the state oil and gas industry contributes to state/local government each fiscal year. Additionally, the reporter could look at the data on the Alaska Department of Revenue’s Tax Division page where oil and gas production tax information is provided.
  * Yes – The reporting team for this story provided sources for all the stories and data in this piece.
  * Yes and no – I believe there are pieces missing to this story. While the life of a VPSO sounds far from ideal, I wish the story provided more detail into the Alaskan State Police response to the inadequate policing of villages and even the recruitment efforts of the VPSOs to increase the size of the volunteer force.

## Quality 

* **Regardless of the form that the graphic/story takes, was it executed at a high degree of quality?** 
  * 3 – The only graphic in this story was a map featuring red dots in the communities where there was no local law enforcement. The map is rather simple. It would have been interesting to pair this map with a different graphic showing the communities that do have local law enforcement and the number of VPSOs in these communities. 
  * 4 - I do believe that the story itself was executed with a high degree of quality. There were numerous sources throughout the story that provided a human element to the data-based evidence of declines in state spending for officers, overworked officers, rising crime rates, etc. The VPSOs interviewed in this story did provide a different sense of tension demonstrating a strained relationship even among the officers themselves. An area that would be interesting to expand on would be the number of “known” sexual offenders and criminals in these small villages. Several crimes highlighted in this story were carried out by “known criminals” which bears the question – is there more that must be done in these villages beyond increasing the number of officers? 

## Type and Color 

* **Based on your knowledge of color and type use, did this person use type and color to their best purpose?**
  * As previously mentioned, this story only had one graphic (a map), which was generic and did not include any kind of type/color besides red dots and a simple font on the map of Alaska. 

## Creativity 

* **Did the piece use some creative elements to good effect? As in, to emphasize those areas that could draw someone in, or to add detail where needed, but not just random visual or story junk that distracts you?** 
  * 3 – The use of photography throughout the story provided the reader with a visual guide of what a rural Alaskan village looks like. The particularly poignant photos were those that showed the exterior of the village peoples’ homes, as well as the interiors. One photo especially - of the boarded-up window through which a sexual offender entered a home and raped a woman – stood out. These photos not only emphasized the living condition in some of these villages, but how these villagers are already without so much and these effects are amplified when they are without basic security and protection. 

# ASSIGNMENT 1 – PITCH

*To: Editor*

*Subject: PITCH: The 2020 Rematch*

Dear *Editor*,

While GOP presidential candidates continue to debate on the national stage, former president Donald Trump’s absence is notable yet insignificant. According to recent polling data, [Trump remains the party’s frontrunner](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/republican-debate-september-poll/#:~:text=By%20this%20standard%2C%20DeSantis%20was,said%20he%20performed%20the%20worst.), meaning the 2024 presidential election will likely be a 2020 rematch between President Biden and Trump. My story will answer the question: who is voting for each candidate and why?

This story will use data from various polls to determine which demographics are voting for President Biden or former President Trump. I will write a profile on each voter representing the various demographic groups aligned with each candidate, party and/or ideology and conduct an interview to determine:
* why the subject is voting for a certain candidate,
* who they voted for in 2020 (if they were eligible to vote then), and 
* if their identity/beliefs have/will inform their candidate selection. 

This story is timely not only because of the upcoming election, but given that the front runners - both over the age of 75 - have emerged during a time when voters are calling for term limits in Congress and an age limit for political leaders. The demographic I am particularly interested in speaking with are college-age and young adult voters who have expressed concern with [aging political leaders](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2023/09/19/americans-dismal-views-of-the-nations-politics/). I will also speak to voters of different economic and education backgrounds, geographic regions, of different gender and sexual identities, and from different religious, ethnic and racial groups.

Given the range of the demographics I want to speak with, I could collect my own dataset by speaking with voters attending the primaries and caucuses scheduled for 2024. It should be noted that the groups in attendance at closed primaries exclude independent voters and usually exclude those who do not regularly participate in elections (i.e. local, state politics), but still may vote in the presidential election.
